# Animation

Welcome to my animation repo!

This repo contains the source files for some of my animations. You can have a look in the [projects](projects) folder.

I also collect some tips for using [Blender](https://www.blender.org) and animation in general, see [tips](tips) folder.

The license for my artworks and blender files is [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) you can remix them however you want. But I would be happy if you tag me on twitter [DariaKolodzey](https://twitter.com/DariaKolodzey), on instagram [i_move_pics](https://www.instagram.com/i_move_pics/) or give a link to this repo.
